# The excursion project

The excursion project is basically a codecamy off platform project.It aims to test the following:

- Ability to read and implement website features using html and css
- Ability to use command line tools to organize project work
- Ability to use git for version control functionality
- Ability to use github for saving project work online

I'm realy at the begining of my web dev journey but I will keep documenting my progress with each project that I do.
See you on the next one.
